    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XVI.&mdash;THE HURLINGHAM GIRL.</h3>

    <p>It is not so easy as it might appear to define the
    Hurlingham Girl with complete accuracy. To say of her that she
    is one whose spirits are higher than her aspirations, would be
    true but inadequate. For, at the best, aspirations are etherial
    things, and those of the Hurlingham Girl, if they ever existed,
    have been so recklessly puffed into space as to vanish almost
    entirely from view. In any case they afford a very
    unsubstantial basis of comparison to the student who seeks to
    infer from them her general character. Yet it would be wrong to
    assume that she has dispensed with the etherial on account of
    her devotion to what is solid. Indeed nothing is more certain
    about her than the contempt with which she has been willingly
    taught to look upon all the attainments that are usually
    dignified with this epithet. History and geography, classics
    and mathematics, modern languages (her own and those of foreign
    nations), all these she candidly despises. Let others make
    their nests upon the shady branches of the tree of learning.
    For herself she is fain to soar into the empyrean of society,
    and to gaze with undazzled eyes into the sun of the smart set.
    She has of course had the advantage of teachers of all sorts,
    but the claims made upon her time by thoughtless parents have
    usually been so great as to leave her at the end of her
    school-room period with a few brittle fragments of knowledge,
    which shift and change in her mind as the bits of glass might
    shift in a kaleidoscope from which the looking-glass had been
    omitted. It is enough for her if, in place of historical dates,
    she knows the fashionable fixtures, whilst Sandown and Kempton,
    Ascot and Goodwood, Hurlingham, and the Ranelagh, supply her
    with a variety of knowledge infinitely more interesting and
    "actual" than the dry details of population, area, climate, and
    capital towns, which may be learnt (by others) from primers of
    geography.</p>

    <p>Although it is, from their and her point of view, eminently
    desirable that the parents of the Hurlingham Girl should be
    rich, yet it is by no means absolutely necessary. It is,
    however, essential that they should possess a social position
    which will ensure to them and to their daughter an easy
    entrance into that world which considers itself, not perhaps
    better, but certainly good. Her mother has probably discovered
    long since that the task of being thwarted by her daughter is
    an intolerable addition to her social burdens. She therefore
    permits her, with as much resignation as she can command, to
    take her own course in all those matters that do not conflict
    directly with the maternal plans, and she may even come to take
    a pride in the bold and dashing independence by which her
    daughter seeks to relieve her of all responsibility, if not of
    all anxiety.</p>

    <p>It is naturally during the London Season that the life of
    the Hurlingham Girl is at its fullest and best. On week-day
    mornings she is a frequent attendant in the Row, the means of
    her father being apparently sufficient to provide her with a
    sleek and showy Park hack and an irreproachable groom. Thence
    she hastens home to rest and dawdle until the hour arrives for
    luncheon, to which meal she has invited the youth who happens
    to be temporarily dancing attendance upon her, for it is
    understood in many houses that luncheon is an open meal for
    which no formal invitation from a parent is necessary. In the
    afternoon there is always a bazaar, an amateur concert, an
    exhibition, a fashionable <i>matin&eacute;e</i> or a Society
    tea-party to be visited. For the evening there are dinners, and
    theatres, and an endless succession of dances, at which the
    flowers, the suppers, and the general decorations possess as
    much or as little variety as the conversation of those who
    overcrowd the rooms to an accompaniment of dance-music that may
    once have been new.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:45%;">
        <a href="images/37.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/37.png"
             alt="Polo game" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>But of course there are distractions. Now and again Society
    seeks relief from its load of care by emigrating <i>en
    masse</i> for the day to a race-meeting at Sandown or Kempton.
    There the Hurlingham Girl is as much at home as though she were
    native to the spot, sprung, as it were, from the very turf
    itself. The interest she takes or pretends to take in racing is
    something astounding. For in truth she knows nothing about
    horses, their points, their pedigrees, or their performances.
    Yet she chatters about them and their races, their jockeys,
    their owners, the weight they carry, their tempers, and the
    state of the betting market, with a glib assurance which is apt
    to put to shame even those of her male companions who have
    devoted a lifetime to the earnest study of these supreme
    matters. In imitation of these gentlemen she will assure those
    who care to listen to her, that she has had a real bad day, not
    having managed to get on to a single winner, and that if it
    hadn't been for a fluke in backing <i>Tantivy</i>, one, two,
    three, she would have been reduced to a twopence in the pound
    condition of beggary. She will then forget her imaginary
    losses, and will listen with amusement and interest while a
    smooth-faced lad criticises with as much severity as he can
    command in the intervals of his cigarettes the dress,
    appearance, and general character of a lady whom she happens to
    dislike. On the following day she will visit Hurlingham in
    order to be looked at as a spectator at a polo match, in which
    she has no interest whatever. After this she is entertained at
    dinner together with a select party, which includes the young
    married lady who is her bosom friend and occasional chaperon,
    by a middle-aged dandy of somewhat shady antecedents, but of
    great wealth and undoubted position. On Sunday mornings she may
    not always go to Church, but she makes up for this neglect by
    the perfect regularity of her attendance at Church parade. In
    the afternoon she will go to Tattersall's to inspect horses.
    Ascot could not continue without her, and Goodwood would
    crumble into ruins if she were absent. This at least is her
    opinion, and thus the months flit by and leave her just as wise
    as they found her. For she never reads a book, and illustrates
    by constant practice her belief that the fashionable
    intelligence of the <i>Morning Post</i> is a sufficient mental
    pabulum for a grown-up woman.</p>

    <p>It is unnecessary to describe further the pursuits and
    occupations of the Hurlingham Girl. With regard to her
    appearance and dress, it must be admitted that she displays
    considerable taste. She is always neat, polished, perfectly
    groomed&mdash;in a word, smart. It may be that it takes nine
    tailors to make a man. It is certain that it takes only one to
    make a well-dressed woman. Yet she does not always, of course,
    wear tailor-made costumes, for on the Sundays that she spends
    on the river, her impertinently poised straw hats, her tasteful
    ribbons, her sailor's knots, her collars, her manly shirts, and
    the general appropriateness of her dress, excite the envy of
    those who declare that they would not imitate her for worlds,
    merely because nature has made it impossible for them to be
    like her. Handsome she is undoubtedly, with the beauty that
    comes of perfect health undisturbed by thoughts of the why and
    the wherefore, or by anticipations of a troublesome to-morrow.
    Yet to the casual observer who beholds this admirably decorated
    creature, her conversation is disappointing. She revels in
    slang. Catch-words and phrases which are not called vulgar only
    because the better classes use them, come trippingly, but never
    with a pleasant effect from her lips. Nor has she that sense of
    reticence which is said to have been the distinguishing mark of
    unmarried girlhood at some former period. That she should talk
    frivolously on great subjects, if she talks on them at all, is
    only to be expected. It would be well if her curiosity and her
    conversation left untouched delicate matters, the existence of
    which she may suspect but ought certainly to ignore.</p>

    <p>After she has thus flaunted her brilliant health and beauty
    through several Seasons, she may begin to tire of an existence,
    which in spite of its general freedom, is subject to certain
    restraints. She therefore decides to emancipate herself by
    submitting to a husband. She finds no difficulty, with the
    assistance of her mother, in discarding the penniless subaltern
    who has devoted himself to her, and whom she has induced to
    believe that she preferred to the whole world. Having received
    an offer from a gentleman of presentable looks and immense
    possessions, she promptly accepts it, and gains to her own
    surprise a considerable reputation for judgment and discretion.
    It is quite possible that after a year or two of giddy married
    life she may decline gradually into a British Matron, respected
    alike on account of her increasing family, and her substantial
    appearance.</p>

    <p>THE BOY THE FATHER OF THE MAN.&mdash;The Chairman of the
    Infant Insurance Committee, asked a skilled witness, "Is a man
    his own child, or another person's child?" This led to an
    altercation, and the room had to be cleared while the question
    was debated. On the return of the Public, the query was
    repeated without a satisfactory result. And yet the evident
    answer is, that he is another person's child, except when he is
    "a self-made man."</p>

    <h2>THE PROFESSIONAL GUEST.</h2>

    <h3>ON A HOUSE-BOAT AT HENLEY.</h3>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>When I received a wire from an old and dear school-friend,
    saying, "LUCY disappointed; come for week; wire me,
    <i>Goldfields</i>, Henley&mdash;KITTY," I felt that the Art
    which I had been so assiduously cultivating for some time past
    was to be put in practice at last. I had long decided that
    there was a grand opening for girls (the true unemployed) in
    the idea, and I had determined to make a good thing out of it
    myself. KITTY' S telegram was somewhat vague, I admit; but
    gossip having thrown a side-light on it, I knew that it came
    from Henley, where she and her husband (whom I had never yet
    seen) had a House-boat for the Regatta week. To answer in the
    affirmative, pack my box, and catch the next train to Henley,
    was small work to a "Professional Guest."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/38-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/38-2.png"
             alt="Woman reading while reclining by a pond" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>When I arrived, I walked straight out of the station to the
    nearest wharf, and, chartering a punt, had my luggage and
    myself placed on board, and then told the small boy, who
    "manned" the craft, to take me to the <i>Goldfields</i>. I was
    not too well pleased when he threw doubts, not only on her
    whereabouts, but on her existence. Neither the small boy nor a
    big man, nor an old woman standing by, knew anything about it;
    and I had determined to take the next train to Town, when a
    flannel-clad young man, with a heavy face and a peevish voice,
    called out from the bank, "I've been looking for you
    everywhere." It proved to be KITTY'S husband, but, as we were
    totally unacquainted with each other's appearances, it was not
    wonderful that his search for me had been ineffectual. He
    seemed much annoyed, however, and only vouchsafed one remark as
    we punted, or, rather, waltzed (for the small boy was a "dry
    bob," I think), down stream towards the <i>Goldfields</i>.
    "It's all KITTY'S fault,&mdash;LUCY'S come." Of course this was
    awkward, but, on arrival, KITTY was so hospitable, and LUCY so
    pretty, that, though our sleeping and dressing apartment was
    astonishingly small, and I made the odd girl out at dinner, I
    felt I could not mind much, and I also got over the little
    <i>contretemps</i> of my dressing-bag being dropped into the
    river&mdash;"by accident," said KITTY'S husband.</p>

    <p>Owing to the heat and the unaccustomed noise of the river,
    neither LUCY nor I slept much; and, though we were told next
    morning we could not have any baths, the whole scene was so
    bright and sparkling that nobody (except KITTY'S husband, who
    seemed of a morose disposition) could with reason have
    complained of anything. It continued to sparkle till the first
    train came down from town, when our guests and the rain arrived
    together. It was a dreadful nuisance, as the awning, which,
    with the flowers, had cost us hours to arrange, speedily got
    soaked, and had to be taken down. Then, of course, the sun came
    out again, and for a time the heat was intense. In fact, one
    lady, who would eat her lunch on the roof, grew quite faint,
    and had to be helped down to KITTY'S husband's room. After
    lunch, we all ventured out in various small craft, and again I
    was unlucky in my waterman. I was sure he had never punted
    before, and it proved to be so; for when I asked him if he had
    had much practice this season, he answered, the while he wrung
    the water from his garments, that "he'd only seen it done, and
    it looked easy." We managed, however, by dint of banging on to
    other people's boats, to get along very well, until an
    ill-judged "shove" sent us right out into the course, just as
    <i>the</i> race of the day was coming along. I am not quite
    clear as to what then took place; only I know that everything
    was "fouled." KITTY'S husband, who had a bet on, was furious,
    and glared at me for the rest of the day&mdash;a condition of
    things I pretended not to see. That night we had a rat-hunt on
    board, but we lost the animal, as LUCY diverted our attention
    by falling into the river. It was most inconvenient of her, as
    she wetted our mutual sleeping apartment dreadfully.</p>

    <p>The second day was almost a <i>replica</i> of the first,
    varied only by KITTY'S husband fancying he had a sunstroke. The
    third and last <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> day was, however, not the
       success we could have wished. During the night the weather
       turned hot, and the food turned&mdash;well, not
       good,&mdash;and next morning the obligatory sacrifice to
       Father Thames was appalling. Then when the necessary viands
       did not arrive from London, I in my capacity of
       "professional guest," and of being always ready for any
       emergency, volunteered to forage in Henley town. Oh! that
       expedition. I fought at the fishmonger's, battled at the
       butcher's and baker's, grovelled at the grocer's, and
       finally ended by committing a theft at the butterman's. The
       number of our visitors was large, and was much augmented by
       friends' friends, who came in battalions. It may have been
       the extra weight on board, or it may be that the hunted rat
       had designed a base revenge, but during lunch, and just as
       KITTY'S husband was beginning to be genial, an odd idea
       seized me that the river was rising. Yes! And the bank
       behind us was rising too. And gracious! the water was
       flowing over the little promenade place, and running about
       the floor of the saloon; and then the <i>Goldfields</i> gave
       a lurch and a shiver, and settled down in the mud, with a
       foot-and-a-half of dirty water downstairs, and nothing but
       the roof left us to perch upon.</p>

    <p>How we ever recovered our belongings I don't know. All I
    remember is, being taken to the station in an old green wherry,
    and coming back to town seventeen in a second-class carriage.
    My last view of the wreck embraced KITTY, propped up against
    the railing of the roof, and making tea on a table, which
    looked more like tipping over than standing straight. KITTY'S
    husband was muttering to himself as he handed round the cups;
    and, as I moved off through the crush of boats, I fancied I
    caught the word "JONAH." Of course I may have been mistaken, as
    my name is not that, but</p>

    <p>According to an evening paper, the wedding-present of
    Colonel GOURAUD to a distinguished couple took the novel and
    charming form of a phonograph, recording, for all time, the
    musical portion of the marriage ceremony. In all probability,
    this precedent will be widely followed, and a set of waxen
    phonographic cylinders will be a familiar feature in the list
    of presents at every wedding of any pretensions to smartness.
    Still, there <i>may</i> be cases in which those who intend to
    imitate Colonel GOURAUD'S example would do well to consider
    first whether the conditions are equally appropriate. For
    instance, young JACK RIVENLUTE is not a bad fellow, though he
    may not be given to sentiment, and VIOLA MANDOLINE is a very
    charming girl, if she <i>is</i> apt to be a trifle high-flown
    and exacting at times. When they marry&mdash;(they have not
    even met at present, but they <i>will</i> marry, the year after
    next, unless <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Own Second-sighted Seer grossly
    deceives himself)&mdash;when they marry, VIOLA'S Uncle JOHN
    will be the person to present them with the then orthodox
    phonograph and appurtenances. But if he could foresee the
    future as distinctly as <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Seer has done in the
    following prophetic visions, he might substitute a biscuit-box,
    or a fish-slice and fork, a Tantalus spirit-case, or even a
    dumb-waiter, as likely, on the whole, to inspire a more
    permanent gratitude.</p>

    lamps? It's pitch dark.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> I'll ring presently&mdash;not just yet. It
    was so <i>dear</i> of you to remember what day it was!</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>who only just remembered it in time, as he
    was driving home</i>). Been a brute if I hadn't!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> You <i>couldn't</i> be a brute, JACK, if you
    tried&mdash;not to <i>me.</i> I'm so glad we haven't got to go
    out anywhere to-night, aren't <i>you</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>heartily</i>). Rather! Beastly bore turning
    out after dinner. What on earth are you up to over there?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> (<i>who has risen, and has apparently been
    winding up some instrument in the corner&mdash;as she
    returns</i>). Oh, it's only something I wanted to do this
    evening.... Now, JACK, listen!</p>

    <p>[<i>The phonograph begins to click and whirr.</i></p>

    <p><i>Jack</i>. That beastly cat in the room again! Turn it out
    quick&mdash;it's going to be ill.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> (<i>laughing a little hysterically</i>).
    No&mdash;no, JACK, it isn't poor Snowball this time! Wait, and
    you will hear something.</p>

    <p>[<i>The "Voice that Breathed o'er Eden" is suddenly rendered
    by an organ and full choir: the remarks of two choristers (who
    are having a little difference over a hymn-book), and the
    subdued sniffs of MRS. MANDOLINE, being distinctly audible
    between the verses.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> (<i>breaking down</i>). Oh, JACK, isn't it
    beautiful? Wasn't it <i>sweet</i> of Uncle JOHN to give it to
    us!</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>who, privately, would have infinitely
    preferred a small cheque</i>). Yes&mdash;he's a good old buffer
    at bottom.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> He's a perfect old <i>love</i>! Tell me,
    JACK, you're not <i>sorry</i> you married me, <i>are</i>
    you?</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> What a thing to ask a fellow Of <i>course</i>
    I'm not!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> (<i>softly</i>). Do you know, JACK, I'm
    sometimes sorry I married <i>you</i>, though.</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>uneasily</i>). Come, I <i>say</i>, you
    know&mdash;what on earth for?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> Because I should like to marry you all over
    again!... Ah, I <i>knew</i> I should frighten you! (<i>The
    final "Amen" of the Choir dies away, amid the coughing,
    rustling, and nasal trumpeting of last year's
    Congregation.</i>) There are some more cylinders,
    JACK&mdash;shall we put them in next?</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>who feels sufficiently solemnised</i>).
    Well, if you ask me, I think they'll keep till next year. Pity
    to disturb the effect of that last, eh?</p>

    <h4><i>Same Scene and Time. Mrs. RIVENLUTE discovered
    alone</i>.</h4>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> He might at <i>least</i> have made
    <i>some</i> allusion to the day&mdash;it would have been only
    <i>decent</i>! He can't possibly have <i>forgotten</i>! I don't
    know, though, very likely he has.... Well, <i>I'm</i> not going
    to remind him! I suppose he means to stay downstairs, smoking,
    as usual, all the evening. Oh, if I could only make him ashamed
    of himself just <i>once</i>!... <i>I</i> know! Uncle JOHN'S
    phonograph! He can't help hearing <i>that</i>. (<i>She winds it
    up, as JACK R. enters, yawning.</i>) Dear me, this <i>is</i> an
    unexpected honour. (<i>Softening slightly.</i>) Have you come
    up to keep me company&mdash;for once?</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> Well, to tell you the truth, my dear, I fancy I
    left the evening paper here. An, there it is.</p>

    <p>[<i>He seizes it, and prepares to go.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> You can read it here, if you <i>like</i>, you
    know&mdash;I don't mind your smoking.</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> Thanks&mdash;but it's cosier in the study.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> Of course I know that any place where I don't
    happen to be is cosier in <i>your</i> opinion.</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> Oh, hang it, don't begin all that
    again&mdash;there, <i>I</i>'ll stay! (<i>He chooses a
    comfortable chair.</i>) What the doose is that?</p>

    <p>[<i>The phonograph has begun to buzz and hum.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> Hush!&mdash;it's Uncle JOHN'S present.</p>

    <p>[<i>The "Wedding March" strikes up with a deafening
    blare.</i></p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>startled</i>). Bless my soul! I thought
    something had blown up. "<i>Hallelujah Chorus</i>," is
    it&mdash;or what?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> (<i>coldly</i>). As it happens, it is
    MENDELSSOHN'S "<i>Wedding March.</i>"</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> Sounded familiar somehow. 'Jove! MENDELSSOHN
    was determined to let 'em know <i>he</i> was married!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> That was intended to let people know
    <i>we</i> were married. It is our Wedding March.</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> Ours? You said it was <i>MENDELSSOHN'S</i> just
    now! But what are you turning it on <i>now</i>, for?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> Do you remember what day this is, by any
    chance?</p>

    <p><i>Jack.</i> Haven't an idea. Isn't there a calendar on your
    writing-table?&mdash;that ought to tell you, if you want to
    know.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> Thank you, <i>I</i> don't require a calendar.
    To-day is the twenty-third&mdash;the day you and I were
    married. [<i>Sighs.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Nearly twelve, and JACK not in yet&mdash;on
    this of all days, too! VIOLA, you will be weak, <i>culpably</i>
    weak, if you don't speak to him, very seriously, when he
    <i>does</i> come in.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. R.</i> (<i>ruefully</i>). I <i>can't</i>, Mother.
    We're not on speaking terms just now, you know.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Then I <i>shall</i>. Fortunately, <i>I</i> am
    on speaking terms with him&mdash;as he will find out! (<i>A
    ring.</i>) There he is, at last! Go, my poor darling, leave me
    to bring him to a sense of his disgraceful conduct. (<i>Mrs. R.
    retires by the back drawing-room.</i>) How shall I begin? Ah,
    poor JOHN'S phonograph! How lucky <i>I</i> remembered it!
    (<i>Selecting a cylinder.</i>) There, if <i>anything</i> can
    pierce his hard heart, <i>that</i> will!</p>

    <p>[<i>Winds up machine, which breaks into a merry marriage
    peal as JACK enters in evening dress.</i></p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>sullenly</i>). Now just look here,
    VIOLA&mdash;(<i>recognising Mrs. M.</i>) Hullo, the Mum!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>raising her voice above the clamour</i>).
    Mum no longer, Sir. Do you hear those bells?</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i>. <i>Do I hear those bells?</i> Am I deaf? The
    whole Parish can hear them, I should think!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I don't care if they do. I want to touch your
    conscience, if I can, and I still hope&mdash;bad as you
    are&mdash;that when the voices of those bells&mdash;so long
    silent&mdash;rung in anticipation of such a very different
    future&mdash;fall upon your ear once more, they may&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Jack</i> (<i>with a sardonic laugh</i>). "So long
    silent!" I like that. Sorry to disappoint you, my dear Mamma,
    but that phonograph, as a domestic stimulant, was played out
    long ago&mdash;it has played <i>me</i> out often enough!
    Perhaps you don't know it, but really VIOLA has rather overdone
    it. Whenever we have a tiff, she sets the "<i>Voice from
    Eden</i>" at me; if she chooses to consider herself ill-used, I
    am treated to a preserved echo of our marriage vows, and the
    Bishop's address; when she is in the sulks, I get the
    congratulations in the vestry; and if ever I grumble at the
    weekly bills, it's drowned in the "<i>Wedding March</i>!" As
    for your precious bells, I can't dine with a man at the Club
    without hearing the confounded things pealing out the moment I
    let myself in. That infernal phonograph,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> which you seem to fondly
       imagine will make me burst into tears, and live happy ever
       after, has driven me out of the house many a time when I was
       willing enough to stay at home; but to be put through one's
       wedding ceremony three times a week is enough to send any
       fellow to the Club, or out of his mind. I'd smash the
       d&mdash;&mdash;d thing with pleasure, only it seems to
       afford VI some consolation. I can't say I find it soothing
       myself.</p>

    <p>"What a sight o' Books!" cries the Baron, remembering the
    clever Parrot who uttered a similar exclamation at a Parrot
    Competition. First, here is <i>Blossom Land and Fallen
    Leaves</i>, by CLEMENT SCOTT, published by HUTCHINSON &amp;
    CO., which is an interesting and useful book to those who are
    able to take a holiday in Cromer, and marvel at the sunset, and
    notice how "in the far distance a couple of lovers advance
    towards the fading light"&mdash;I'll be bound that deeply
    engaged couple didn't catch sight of the "chiel takin'
    notes"&mdash;and how did <i>he</i> know for certain they were a
    couple of lovers? Why not brother and sister? Why not husband
    and wife? Why not uncle and aunt?&mdash;but with an experienced
    eye the canny SCOTT made a pretty shrewd guess&mdash;and it is
    a pleasant companion, is this book, to those who cannot visit
    Cromer, or any of the other places mentioned in <i>Blossom
    Land</i>, and who reading it at home will only wish they could
    do so, and will promptly make arrangements for paying (the
    "paying" <i>is</i> the difficult part) a visit not only to
    Cromer but also to Caen, Etretat, Cabourg,&mdash;carefully
    noting C.S.'s account of his "cruise upon wheels," and his
    sensible remarks on Parisianising these otherwise tranquil
    resorts. From Havre to Hammersmith is a bit of a jump, but it
    is from a bustling port to a peaceful spot&mdash;"a Harbour of
    Refuge" at Nazareth, where the Baron sincerely trusts the good
    Little Sisters of the Poor are no longer Poor-rated &pound;120
    per annum, just by way of parochial encouragement, I suppose,
    to other charitable persons for relieving the parish "of an
    incubus of four hundred." The work of these self-sacrificing
    women cannot be over-rated in one sense, but in the parochial
    sense (if parochials have any) they can hardly be rated enough.
    Really a delightful book for all comers and goers.</p>

    <p>"What have we here?" inquires the Baron&mdash;<i>Seven
    Summers, An Eton Medley, by the Editors of the Parachute and
    Present Etonian</i>. Now, Heaven forgive my ignorance, but I
    have never seen the <i>Parachute</i> nor the <i>Present
    Etonian</i>, so without prejudice I dip into this book, and am
    at once much interested and amused by a paper "On Getting Up."
    Not "getting up" linen, or "getting up lessons," but getting up
    in the morning, ever a hard-worker's hardest task. It will
    remind many a middle-aged Etonian of the days when he was very
    young, and early school was very early. "The Inner Man" is
    another amusing paper, and forty years has made no alteration
    in the "sock-cad." American slang has evidently tinged Etonian
    style. "What in the name of purple thunder," and "in the name
    of spotted Moses," and so forth, are Americanisms, and the tone
    of these two smart Etonian writers has a certain Yankee ring in
    it. Why not leave this sort of thing to MARK TWAIN, BRET HARTE
    &amp; CO., who are past masters of their own native slang?
    <i>Seven Summers</i> will interest and amuse Etonians of all
    ages.</p>

    <p>And here, attracted by a quaintly-designed cover, the Baron
    takes up <i>Ballads from Punch, and other Poems</i>, by WARHAM
    ST. LEGER, published by DAVID STOTT. That a considerable number
    of these have appeared in <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages, by whose
    kind permission they are reprinted, is quite sufficient
    guarantee for their excellence. <i>The Lay of the Lost Critic,
    The Plaint of the Grand Piano</i>, are capital specimens of the
    author's humour, and <i>Christmas Eve</i> of his true pathos.
    No influence of American humour visible in any of these. As a
    rule, the Baron doesn't recommend betting, but advises his
    readers to go in for this St. Leger.</p>

    <p>The contents of <i>The Universal Review</i> this month are
    varied, interesting, but not sensational. The article on
    Westminster Abbey, by FREDERICK GEORGE LEE, D.D., with its
    humorous notes and observations, will have a charm for many
    readers, and so will that on the painter BERNADINO LUINI. The
    novel entitled, <i>The Wages of Sin</i>, is now at the first
    chapter of the fifth book, and there is an illustration
    representing a lady in a Victoria pulling up in Waterloo Place.
    Underneath is the legend&mdash;"She leaned forward smiling,
    beckoning as the Victoria drew up against the curb." First, she
    is not leaning forward; secondly, she doesn't appear to be
    "smiling;" thirdly, she doesn't seem to be "beckoning;" and,
    fourthly, though the horse is being pulled back, probably on
    the "curb," yet, if the author means that the carriage is being
    pulled up against the pavement, then why didn't he say so, and
    write it "kerb?" I like being a trifle hypercritical just now
    and then, says THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <h2>AN INTERNATIONAL HERO.</h2>

    <p>There has been recently a discussion in <i>The World</i> as
    to where <i>Cox and Box</i> (for which Sir ARTHUR wrote some of
    his best music) first saw the light. It was decided in favour
    of the Librettist at whose residence the Triumviretta was given
    privately, in presence of a distinguished audience. But there
    was one person who might have given invaluable evidence, and
    that was <i>Box</i> himself. Why did he not step forward? Where
    was he? The explanation is given in the Paris <i>Figaro</i> of
    Thursday, July 17:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"M. Box, le nouveau Ministre d'Ha&iuml;ti &agrave;
            Paris, a &eacute;t&eacute; re&ccedil;u hier matin
            par</p>

            <p>le Pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Of course, Cox will receive an appointment. Perhaps M. Box
    banks at Cox's. Will Sergeant-Major BOUNCER be gazetted to the
    Hayti'eth Regiment? Whatever may be in store for these immortal
    personages, it is satisfactory to know that, for the present,
    <i>Box</i> at least is provided for. It was like his true
    British nature not to disguise his identity under some such
    gallicised form of his name as BOITE, or LOGE. There is,
    perhaps, no surname in our language so truly national as
    <i>Box</i>. "JOHN BOX" might well be substituted for "JOHN
    BULL." It is characteristic of our British pugilism. <i>Vive M.
    Box!</i></p>

    <p>Various events are approaching, and it is only fair that I
    should give the readers of this journal the benefit of my
    advice and my opinions. In good time I shall have something to
    say about Goodwood&mdash;something that will make the
    pal&aelig;olithic cauliflower-headed dispensers of buncombe and
    bombast sit up and curse the day on which fate allowed them to
    be born. There are some who profess to attach importance to the
    goose-billed mouthings and vapourings of the butter-brained
    crew who follow in the wake of the most notorious professor of
    humbugging pomposity that even this age, rich as it is in
    putty-faced impostors, has ever produced. Well, let them. For
    my own part I follow the advice of the French King to the
    beautiful Marquise DE CENTAMOURS. "<i>Sire</i>," the
    <i>Marquise</i> is reported to have said, "<i>quelle heure
    est-il?</i>" To which the witty monarch at once replied,
    "<i>Madame, si vous avez besoin de savoir l'heure, allez done
    la demander au premier gendarme?</i>" The story may be found
    with others in the lately published memoirs of Madame DE
    SANSFA&Ccedil;ON. In a similar spirit I answer those who pester
    me about horses.</p>

    <p>I understand that <i>Barrister Bill</i>,
    <i>Sidesplitter</i>, and <i>Fiery Harry</i>, showed up
    excellently at Newmarket last week. I have always prophesied
    well of these three splendid animals, who take their feeds as
    regularly, and with as much gusto as they gallop a mile on
    heather when the barometer points to set fair. At the same time
    I consider that only a papoose, made of string and sawdust,
    would give more than &pound;10,000 for any one of them.</p>

    <p>Complaints have reached me that some of my remarks have
    given pain in an exalted quarter. It is the common lot of those
    who are honest to be misunderstood, and, for myself, I wish to
    claim no exemption from the rule. My one aim is to benefit my
    readers, and to advance truth. For this I would sacrifice the
    smiles of Courts, and incur the shallow sneers of the
    grovelling, chowder-headed horde of flunkeys who sit in high
    places. My work bears witness to my merit. Need I say more?</p>

    <h2>A SWEET HOME FOR NANCY.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;The other evening, wishing to enjoy a
    little music, I went to the Lyric Theatre, and found that the
    opera chosen for performance was called <i>Sweet Nancy</i>,
    founded upon a novel with some similar title by Miss RHODA
    BROUGHTON. The prettiest tune I heard was one that I fancy had
    been played before, and my belief is the stronger as Mr. HENRY
    NEVILLE referred to it as "a dear old song." It had to do with
    "<i>Darby and Joan</i>," and reminded me of J.L. MOLLOY'S
    delightful song with that title. The rest of the music was not
    very striking. Even to those who hold that the plot of an Opera
    is only of secondary importance, <i>Sweet Nancy</i> could not
    have appeared to be exactly teeming with incidents. However, it
    was very nicely played by Miss HUGHES, and that now mature
    Lancashire Lad, the aforesaid HENRY NEVILLE. Without declaring
    that I should like to see it every evening for a thousand years
    (which I believe is a <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i> even in
    China), I certainly could sit it out again. If I wished to be a
    fault-finder I should say that the piece is too long, and seems
    all the longer because some of the characters are supposed to
    represent schoolboys, and a girl of thirteen. The adapter is
    Mr. BUCHANAN&mdash;a poet and a playwright. This gentleman, I
    believe, has made many other pieces (more or less) his own,
    with (more or less) success. He seems to have a knack of
    turning old plays into new ones. I live in hope that when I
    next visit this great Metropolis I shall find that he has
    re-written the <i>School for Scandal</i>, and brought
    <i>Hamlet</i> up to date.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Monday to Saturday</i>.&mdash;Nothing particular this
    week. Second July Meeting at Newmarket took a lot of people
    away, and the thunder, hail and rain frightened a lot more away
    on Thursday, so may as well discuss <i>Esmeralda</i>, which I
    hadn't time to do last week. Rather a mixed affair to start
    with when you have a French <i>libretto</i>, set by an English
    Composer, and played at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden.
    No matter. A big success for everyone concerned, from
    DRURIOLANUS downwards. No one could have wished for a better
    <i>Esmeralda</i> than Madame MELBA, though she did not make the
    most of that first charming song, "<i>L'Hirondelle</i>." One
    Swallow, however, doesn't make an Opera, and Madame MELBA soon
    pulled herself together, and threw herself into the work when
    she saw Mons. JEAN DE RESZK&Eacute;, as <i>Phoebus</i>, winning
    fresh laurels.</p>

    <p>The <i>Quasimodo</i> of M. DUFRICHE, of the Vibrato school,
    was dramatically good, but not great; but <i>Claude Frollo</i>
    was both great and good. These two have been defrauded of their
    rights by the undramatic Librettist, who has done about as
    little as possible with the excellent materials at his command.
    What a scene might have been the final one between
    <i>Quasimodo</i> and <i>Claude</i>, when <i>Claude Frollo</i>
    is pitched over the battlements. I forget what becomes of
    <i>Quasi</i>; but if he stabs himself, or is stabbed, that
    would be quite sufficient for dramatic justice and effect.
    Then, of course, the absurd ceremony used by <i>Clopin</i>, and
    the real unwillingness of <i>Esmeralda</i> to become
    <i>Gringoire's</i> wife, would dispose of the marriage, unless
    <i>Gringoire</i> were previously got rid of (for I don't
    remember how the novel ends) and <i>Esmeralda</i> would be
    united to <i>Phoebus</i>, while <i>Fleur-de-Lys</i> could marry
    <i>De Chevreuse</i>, or anybody else.</p>

        <h3>HOW IT OUGHT TO HAVE ENDED.</h3>Mr. Justice Butt
        pronounces a decree of divorce. Phoebus marries Esmeralda.
        Claude Frollo is smashed, and Quasimodo is stabbed.
    </div>

    <p>The Goat, too, has a wretched part: to be left out after the
    first scene is too bad. Something might have been done with
    him, if he had only been put into a chaise; but perhaps
    <i>Esmeralda</i> and <i>Phoebus</i> reserve him for further use
    in the course of a couple of years or so, when <i>Djali</i>,
    drawing a goat-chaise containing a little <i>Esmeralda</i> and
    a little <i>Phoebus</i>, followed by a nurse and Papa and
    Mamma, would make a sensation at some fashionable seaside
    resort.</p>

             the second principal part in this Opera. If they don't
             produce <i>Dinorah</i>, I shall give notice. Too bad
             of Goring Thomas. If I see him alone I'll show him
             what 'Butting' Thomas is."
    </div>

    <p>Mons. MONTARIOL played and sang well as <i>Gringoire</i>,
    and Mons. WINOGRADOFF was most artistic as <i>Clopin</i>,
    Amusing to see Mons. LASSALLE as <i>Claude Frollo</i>,
    melodramatically hiding behind the window-curtains, just as
    <i>Phoebus</i> enters the room followed by <i>Esmeralda</i>. So
    evidently was the curtain shaken, that <i>Phoebus</i> would
    most certainly have detected the sneak, or he might have asked
    <i>Esmeralda</i>, "What's that?" and have asserted his belief
    that it could not possibly be the cat, but he might have
    accepted her explanation had she informed him that it was the
    Goat. What a chance here lost for a situation of the Goat
    behind curtains butting <i>Claude Frollo</i>! However, it was
    all "purtendin'," and JEAN DE RESZK&Eacute; as <i>Phoebus</i>
    didn't see what he would most certainly have noticed
    immediately had he been himself. Magnificently got up;
    <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> excellent; band and chorus all that
    could be wished.</p>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <div class="figleft"

             Morning Post</i>.
    </div>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 14.</i>&mdash;Government
    again narrowly escaped defeat. Last time it was Ascot; this
    time Marlborough House Garden Party. "This Session," says T.
    HARRINGTON, "I've taken to subscribing to <i>The Morning
    Post</i>; study its fashionable news; look out for arrangements
    likely to draw men away from House; then me and SAGE put our
    heads together; arrange for Division; take it smart, and
    Government left in lurch."</p>

    <p>To-day opportunity found in Motion for Select Committee on
    constitution of Scotch Committee. AKERS-DOUGLAS proposed
    twenty-one members, all Scotch but one. "Let us have the lot
    Scotch," says ROBERTSON; moves Amendment accordingly. House
    pretty full, knowing crisis at hand; Government Whips scouting
    for Members.</p>

    <p>"Tell you what I'll do," says PENROSE FITZGERALD to
    AKERS-DOUGLAS; "I hate garden-parties and that sort of thing,
    but as we shall be in a hole if Division now rushed, I'll take
    cab, run up to Marlborough House, fetch down some men;
    inconvenient, you know; works against grain; would rather be
    down here helping you than mingling in glittering throng; but,
    as the Governor says, duty is our loadstar; say the word, and
    I'll go off to Pall Mall and fetch a lot down."</p>

    <p>"FITZGERALD," said AKERS-DOUGLAS, wringing his hand, "you're
    a brick. You always think of the right thing, and are ready to
    do it."</p>

    <p>DOUGLAS paused to wipe away tear drawn from his sensitive
    glands by this evidence of self-sacrifice. When he'd done it,
    looking again at FITZGERALD'S briskly-retreating figure,
    couldn't help noting how smartly he was got up; summer pants;
    white waistcoat; the short "reefer," familiar in the Lobby,
    cast aside for the courtly frock coat; observed him as he
    strode forth, producing pair of lavender kid gloves.</p>

    <p>"Odd," said DOUGLAS, reflectively. "FITZGERALD never
    expected to go to Garden Party; down here to help me; sudden
    emergency, and spirit of self-devotion, suggested to him to run
    over, and see what could be done; happy chance to find him, by
    exception, in the right rig. It would never have done for him
    to rush over to Marlborough House to meet the QUEEN in his
    'reefer.' Curious, when I come to think of it. Hope there's not
    more in it than meets the eye."</p>

    <p><i>But there was.</i></p>

    <p>Debate on ROBERTSON'S Amendment abruptly closed; Division
    rushed; position of Government critical; AKERS-DOUGLAS
    anxiously on look-out for FITZGERALD and the Marlborough House
    relief party; but they came not, and on Division Government
    saved by skin of teeth and eight votes. An hour later, PENROSE
    FITZGERALD returned to Lobby with guilty look; carefully
    avoided AKERS-DOUGLAS; that able captain too broken-hearted at
    the perfidy to be angry; "NOAH'S dove didn't treat him so," he
    said to himself; but all he said to FITZGERALD was, "Pleasant
    Party at Marlborough House, I suppose?" "Yee-es," said
    FITZGERALD; "rather; couldn't get back quite as soon as I
    expected."</p>

    his chief, but got such fearful pummelling retired into silence
    for rest of sitting. What made it worse for ARTHUR was
    Chairman's ruling; pulled him up more than once amid loud
    cheers from Opposition. TIM HEALY on war-path; quotes TENNYSON
    with odd variation; represents Prince ARTHUR as saying of Irish
    Members, "You have not got the pose that marks the cast of VERE
    DE VERE." Proceedings occasionally lively; grow a little
    monotonous after first five hours. Met STUART hurrying off,
    humming to himself the air, "<i>Haste to the Wedding</i>."</p>

    <p>"Aren't you going to stay for division?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"No," said he. "I mustered; strikes only on the box; when
    you ask for it, see that you get it; none other genuine. Have
    an important engagement to-morrow morning. If you're waking
    COLMAN early, COLMAN early, TOBY dear."</p>

    <p>Stared at this incoherent speech; thought at first he was

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>E pur si muove</i>; that is to
    say, it <i>will</i> move; they'll all move, in spite of
    BRAMWELL. London, probably, the only population in the world
    that possesses the supernatural patience necessary to submit to
    having its movements obstructed by bars and gates put up across
    some of its principal thoroughfares. Oddly enough, they
    congregate round congeries of Railway Stations in the North.
    To-day, ROSEBERY in Lords moves Second Reading of Bill designed
    to have them swept away. BRAMWELL protests. "Speaking," he
    said, "in name of over two hundred people who live in district
    affected by the Bill, I ask your Lordships to reject it." This
    too much even for House of Lords. That alleged luxury of two
    hundred people should weigh against convenience of the
    population of London was a little monstrous. BRAMWELL kept his
    countenance admirably. LORD CHANCELLOR looked on
    admiringly.</p>

    <p>"That's the man for <i>me</i>, TOBY," he said. "If we could
    only have a House of Lords all BRAMWELLS, with me on Woolsack,
    we'd make Old England once more a merry spot."</p>

    <p>Rest of House, however, would not enter into joke. MARKISS
    admitted that, being a constant passenger by Great Northern
    Railway, he generally "said a dam" when passing these gates.
    This felt to be a shocking state of things. Gates and bars must
    be bundled off, if only to prevent use of bad language by PRIME
    MINISTER. BRAMWELL reluctantly admitted this, still pleading
    with touching eloquence for preservation of the
    obstruction.</p>

    <p>"My Lords," he said, "think of what you're doing to this
    great capital, of which we are all so justly proud. The Tower
    has become a disused place, and its historic hill no more
    reverberates to the merry chopping of the headsman's axe.
    Temple Bar has gone, and long ago have vanished the heads that
    used to look wistfully down on the passing chairmen. The
    chairmen themselves have sped into eternity, and in their place
    circles the Hansom cab. No more does the lovely, lonely oil
    lamp swing at the corners of our streets. Your Lordships can
    wend your way homeward as far West as Kensington, or as far
    North as Highbury, without meeting the casual footpad. The town
    is drained; the river is embanked; our streets are paved; and
    we have a penny post. Almost all that is left to us of the good
    old times are these bars, arbitrarily set up across our
    thoroughfare, watched by a gentleman in a seedy suit, and a
    rain-beaten hat girt with tarnished golden lace. I beseech your
    Lordships, by your memories of infancy, by your love of our old
    Constitution, by the faith of your Order, by your fidelity to
    your Sovereign, to spare these last lingering relics of the
    London that helped to make our Empire great."</p>

    <p>House plainly touched at this outburst of eloquence. Lord
    BANGOR closed his eyes, and clasped his hands, as if in Church.
    If there can be any arrangement made in Committee by which the
    gates and bars, after removal, may be placed in convenient
    order round BRAMWELL'S residence, so that he shall be forced to
    make <i>d&eacute;tours</i> as he goes about his daily business,
    it shall be done. With this understanding, Amendment withdrawn,

    ARTHUR and recent inmates of the prisons. O'BRIEN protests that

    personal appearance in proof that things are not so bad as they
    are painted. "Four times you've been in prison," he urged, "and
    see how well you look." DILLON takes objection to the prison
    garb; discloses strong yearning to see Prince ARTHUR arrayed in
    it. ARTHUR quite content with his present tailor. SHAW-LEFEVRE
    joins in conversation; ARTHUR looks at him longingly. "They say
    we shan't be in office another year, TOBY,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> he observed, as SHAW-LEFEVRE
       proceeded at some length; "but I should like to be CHIEF
       SECRETARY long enough to get a chance of running
       SHAW-LEFEVRE in. He's very slippery; knows how near he may

    <h2>A SPORTING STYLE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With Examples.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Prefatory Note.</i>&mdash;It is a common mistake to
    suppose that the present generation frowns upon the literary
    achievements of the descriptive reporter who chronicles the
    great deeds of athletes, oarsmen, pugilists, and sportsmen
    generally. On the contrary, if we may pretend to judge from a
    wide and long-continued study, we should say that the <i>vates
    sacer</i> of the present day, though he may not rival his
    predecessors in refinement and classical allusion, is by no
    means inferior to them in wealth of language and picturesque
    irrelevancy. Sporting reporting, in fact, was never more of a
    fine art, and on the whole has rarely been better paid, than it
    is at the present day. In the hope that many a young journalist
    may be helped in his struggle for fame and fortune, <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> proposes to publish a short manual of sporting
    reports, with examples and short notes, that may explain the
    <i>technique</i> of the business to the aspirant.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>RULES.</h3>

    <p>1. Always remember that you are a sporting reporter, and be
    as sportive as you can. The dig-in-the-ribs and
    chuck-her-under-the-chin style is always effective.</p>

    <p>2. Speak of everybody by his Christian name or his
    nick-name.</p>

    <p>3. If you think a man ought to have a nickname, invent one
    for him.</p>

    <p>4. Employ stock quotations wherever they are least required,
    and give a music-hall flavour to every report.</p>

    <p>5. If possible, misquote.</p>

    <p>6. Avoid all simple language.</p>

    <p>7. Patronise all titled sportsmen, and pat wealthy
    bookmakers on the back.</p>

    <p>8. Never miss an opportunity of showing that you are on
    familiar terms with the sun, moon, rain, wind, and weather in
    general. Do this, as a rule, by means of classical tags
    vulgarised down to the level of a costermonger's cart.</p>

    <p>9. Spin out your sentences.</p>

    <p>10. Mix up your metaphors, moods, tenses, singulars,
    plurals, and the sense generally.</p>

    <p>11. Refer often to "the good old days" you don't remember,
    and bewail the decadence of sport of all kinds.</p>

    <p>12. Occasionally be haughty and contemptuous, and make a
    parade of rugged and incorruptible honesty. In short, be as
    vain and offensive as you can.</p>

    <p>13. Set yourself up as an infallible judge of every branch
    of sport and athletics.</p>

    <p><i>First Example</i>.&mdash;Event to be reported: An
    American pugilist arrives at Euston, and is received by his
    English friends and sympathisers.</p>

    <h3>O'FLAHERTY IN ENGLAND.</h3>

    <h4>ARRIVAL OF THE CHAMPION. HIS RECEPTION. WHAT HE THINKS OF
    ENGLAND.</h4>

    <p>It was somewhere towards "the witching hour of noon" that
    the broad and splendid artery of commerce, to wit, the Euston
    Road, became, for the nonce, a scene of unwonted, and
    ever-increasing excitement. Old Plu<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       had promised, as per Admiral FITZROY'S patent
       hocus-pocusser, to give us a taste of his quality; and it is
       unnecessary, in this connection, to observe that the
       venerable disciple of Swithin the Saint was as good as his
       word. But Britons never never shall be slaves. England
       expected every man to do his duty. Forward the Light
       Brigade, and so on to where glory and an express train were
       waiting, or would be waiting, before you had time to knock a
       tenpenny nail on the head twice. The company on the platform
       comprised the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the sporting world.
       "Bluff" TOMMY POPPIN, the ever courteous host of "The
       Chequers," "BILL" TOOTWON, by his friends yclept the Masher,
       JAKE RUMBELO, the middle-weight World's Champion, were all
       there, wreathed in silvery smiles, and all on the nod, on
       the nod, on the nod, as the poet hath it, though why "hath
       it" no man can tell, in words that will last while Old Sol,
       the shiner, drives his spanking tits along the azure road.
       Punctual to the moment the train steamed into the station,
       and the giant form of O'FLAHERTY, the "man in a million,"
       leaped out of the railway carriage, amid the plaudits of all
       the blue blood of England's sports. In answer to inquiries
       the Champion laughingly said, "he guessed this was a mighty
       wet country for a dry man," and proceeded to the
       refreshment-room, where he "asked a p'leece-man"&mdash;oh
       no, not at all, but, "Deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee, he
       drank the foaming juice of Grapes." Thence a move was made
       to the palatial office of the <i>Sporting Standard</i>,
       where the Champion was introduced to the Staff. Hands all
       round followed, and a glorious day wound up with a visit to
       the theatrical resorts of the latter-day Babylon, in company
       with some of the right sort, though these be getting both
       fewer and farther between than in the good old days.</p>

    <p>As there appears to be some confusion with regard to the
    exact nature of the programme scheme for the forthcoming Naval
    Autumn Manoeuvres, the following sketch, gleaned from recent
    inquiry on the subject made at Whitehall, may, if he can manage
    to follow it, possibly serve to enlighten the uninitiated
    outsider.</p>

    <p>An enemy's fleet, having, it is supposed, escaped the
    vigilance of the Channel Squadron, consisting of H.M.
    First-class Battle-ship <i>Blunderer</i>, accompanied by the
    third-class cruiser <i>Jack-ass</i>, and the torpedo-boats
    <i>Corkscrew</i> and <i>Tooth-brush</i>, which, also it is
    supposed, represent a fleet of thirty-six iron-clads,
    twenty-six armoured cruisers, attended by fifty torpedo
    vessels, have sailed victoriously up the Thames, and, having
    seized the Serpentine, command the, equally supposed, Milk
    Supply of Bayswater, Paddington, and the whole of the North of
    London. This news having been conveyed to another fancied fleet
    that is covering a convoy of ships, imagined to be attempting
    to land corn, that they have brought from ports across the
    Atlantic, simultaneously at Pegwell Bay, Margate, and the Isle
    of Dogs, it is again supposed that, acting under sealed orders,
    they elude the enemy, and dividing their forces, make for
    Gravesend, Liverpool, Dundee, "The Welsh Harp" at Hendon, and
    Yarmouth. The problem, therefore, presented to Admiral FLYOFF,
    who is in command of the defending squadrons, will be, after
    utilising the supposed coast defences, and mining the
    Serpentine, to force the enemy to accept the issue of an open
    action on the Regent's Canal, and the Ornamental Water at the
    Crystal Palace. Failing this, it will be left to the Umpires,
    who, being supposed to be in several places at the same time,
    will be provided with a tricycle, fog-horn, and telescope, to
    enable them to adjudge the exact amount of success or failure
    following respectively on each effort, with as near a
    resemblance as is possible to the probable issues in real
    warfare. Any matters remaining in dispute and undecided, will
    be ultimately settled by the First Lord, who will toss up with
    a two-headed halfpenny, specially provided for, in the
    Estimates, for the purpose.</p>

    <p>A glance at the above will show that the scheme, though
    simple in conception, may easily become complicated; but if
    kept in view, with an accompanying reference to the daily
    letters of the Correspondents of five Penny Papers, by anyone,
    who will further pick out the names and positions of places
    named, and mark them with pins on the Railway Map attached to
    <i>Bradshaw's Guide</i>, it may serve to throw some light on
    the course of events, and leave the inquiring investigator,
    though still very much at sea, yet in possession of some scraps
    of useful information.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
